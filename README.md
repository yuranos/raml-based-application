This repo also contains some examples on how to configure JUnit5 and Spock for Spring Boot. It's a code that was used to create a presentation ["Whitebox testing of Sring Boot application"](https://www.slideshare.net/IuriiNosenko/whitebox-testing-of-spring-boot-applications-89271319)
You can find it in a separate branch - `unit_tests`.
